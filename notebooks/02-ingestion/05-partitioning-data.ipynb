    "This notebook is a review of Apache Druid's data organization strategy and how it can be used to improve system health and query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Apache Druid stores data in Segment files](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/segments). Druid Segments have a columnar structure designed for high performance analytic queries. Segments are organized into consistent time intervals called the `Segment Granularity` of the table and typically expressed as HOUR, DAY, MONTH, or YEAR. In this notebook you will review how this setting affects the number of segments created during ingestion and the size of those segments. Druid works best when segments are balanced in size with a general rule of thumb that they should cover approximately 5 million rows each. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Pruning](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/architecture#query-processing) is the process of reducing the segment files that need to be inspected in order to resolve a query. To process a query in Druid, all the time chunks that overlap the query's filter condition on the __time column will be inspected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within a time chunk, [segment files can be organized based on another set of columns](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/partitioning). In SQL Based ingestion it's specified using a [CLUSTERED BY clause](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/reference#clustered-by). When you use this feature, Druid will organize the segments within a time chunk such that each one covers a range of the values from the clustering columns. At query time the Broker can do additional pruning of the segments within a time chunk if the user specifies a filter condition on the clustering columns. "

    "- `flights-year` - Here you are using a single segment, it is much larger at 500k+ rows, but Druid can still use the indexes associated to all dimension columns to process this pretty fast and it only does it once, so this is faster then hourly. This shows how the number of segments needed for a query is a factor for performance. Less segments to process tends to improve perfomance, but not always.\n",

    "- `flights-year-IATA` - Given the shard spec of the 12 resulting segments, you can see that there are rows with IATA Code \"AA\" in 2 of the segments. They are both processed in parallel and there are less segments to process, so this results in the fastest. \n",
