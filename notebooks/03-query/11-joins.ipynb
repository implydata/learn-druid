    "Apache Druid can do joins at query time through both its native engine (scatter/gather) and through the Multi-Stage Query engine.\n",
    "Note that the best performance will always be without using any joins, so the overall recommendation is to join the data at ingestion when loading in batch, or upstream of ingestion for streaming scenarios. But pre-joining the data isn't always an option, so you'll need to learn how to use Druid to process joins as efficiently as possible for those cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook you will run tests on the performance of different approaches to joining data, seeing how different JOIN operations are processed and how to write SQL that will take advantage of how it works in each case.\n",
    "The notebook also covers alternatives to joins using UNION ALL strategies or application side code. \n"

This creates a situation where pre-joining the data is not viable and the datasets can both be large. In this example the forecast data isn't very big but it will help illustrate how UNION ALL can be used to resolve this type of query.\n",

    "    * order of the joined tables is important, the larger table should be listed first such that it drives parallelization of the join\n",
    "    * there is a limit to how much data can be broadcast set by either `maxSubQueryRows` or `maxSubQueryBytes` limits\n",
    "    * you can raise the subquery limits but it comes at the cost of more Heap memory used on the Broker, Historicals, and Streaming Tasks to resolve the query and more data transmitted from the Broker to all the others involved in the query\n",
