    "Apache Druid is known for fast performance on both historical and real-time data. These queries are resolved through the synchronous API endpoints `/druid/v2` & `/druid/v2/sql` that use Druid's native engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous queries from Deep Storage with API endpoint `/druid/v2/sql/statements` were introduced in the 27.0.0 release along with Druid retention rules with no historical caching. This allows Druid users to query longer timeframes without the need to cache all data in the historical layer. This set of features enabled users to optimize their cluster cost by only cacheing recent data in the historical layer and leaving older segment data available for queries in deep storge. \n",
    "\n",
    "At that stage, asynchronous queries were only accessing segments that were avaialble in Deep Storage, so the latest streaming ingested data would not be visible in the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Druid 28.0.0, the asynchronous query capability is expanded to query real-time tasks which allows this type of query to access the complete timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to work with [Query From Deep Storage](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/api-reference/sql-api#query-from-deep-storage). In this tutorial you perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate 3 months of data and use batch ingestion to load it.\n",
    "- Setup stream ingestion for live data from generator.\n",
    "- Setup Retention rules to only hold 1 month of data in Historical cache.\n",
    "- Use synchronous and asynchronous queries to show timeline coverage of each case."
