# Chicago Taxi Data - ingesting using INSERT

Below you'll find sample `INSERT` statements for the Chicago Taxi Data, starting with a basic statement, and advancing through different functionality. Each change applies one of the data modelling principles from the training course by Imply.

* [Apache Druid Ingestion and Data Modeling](https://learn.imply.io/apache-druid-ingestion-and-data-modeling)

Note that these scripts were built for basic auth to min.io - you will need to connect to your external data in the usual way.

It's also a good idea to ensure you've split up the incoming data. Then you can address the `EXTERN` to a few of the files at first to check that the ingestion works OK, and to check the effect that it has on query execution and patterns. Below, you will see that, because S3-compatible storage was being used, specific `uris` are used in the `EXTERN` rather than a prefix.

## Starting out

The dataset has two timestamps, so here we apply the [RADStack paper](http://static.druid.io/docs/radstack.pdf) principle strictly that event rows are "about when the event occured" by using the Trip End Timestamp as the __time field value. This requires a `COALESCE` on the `__time` because the `Trip End Timestamp` is not always present; we need to deal with the potential for `NULL` values.

## Principle 3 - superfluous columns

Now there's quite a few columns we don't need either logically or through conversation with our imaginary web developer. Notice that this script also checks that the types are all good on the `EXTERN`.

* Checked incoming column types to make sure they are numeric when they need to be
* Removes superfluous columns (census tract, trip ID, start time, and the lat / long columns)
* Corrected the calculation of percentages to handle divide by zero

## Principle 5 - granularity and precision

Now we get to reduce the granularity for the intended graphical elements of the UI. We also create datasketches out of the high-cardinality columns: a) they would otherwise lower the roll-up ratio, and b) our imaginary users are fine with trend information and they're never gonna filter / sort by the Taxi Id or Trip Id.

* Added GROUP BY and converted a lot of measures into aggregated metrics of various types
* Added HLL for Taxi Id for approximate distinct count, and Trip Id back in with Theta for set operations.

## Principle 6 - Segment organization

Final principle, applying segment organisation.

In conversation with imaginary web developers, and looking at segment sizes and so on, the data is now `PARTITIONED BY MONTH`. And as payment type and the taxi company appear to be the most common filters during the prototype testing, these are what's used in `CLUSTERED BY`.

* Partitioned by MONTH to allow for month-over-month comparisons in parallel
* Clustered by commonly filtered dimensions

> In testing, the following version completed in _one quarter_ of
> the time that the original "starting out" version took to complete.
