# Connect to clickstream data

Event hubs allow clickstream data to be collected and transported to Druid quickly, and is a very common implementation pattern.

* Learn about streaming ingestion and try the [notebook](../../02-ingestion/01-streaming-from-kafka.ipynb).
* Learn about [multi-topic Apache Kafka streaming ingestion](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/kafka-ingestion#ingest-from-multiple-topics) and try the [notebook](../../02-ingestion/11-stream-from-multiple-topics.ipynb).

Very busy websites create very large volumes of data. When Druidâ€™s ingestion throughput is too low, pressure builds up on the ingestion side, resulting in visitor actions not being available for query quickly enough.

* Monitor [ingestion lag metrics](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/metrics/#ingestion-metrics).
* Partition the stream and balance with enough [ingestion tasks](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/supervisor#io-configuration) using `ioConfig/taskCount`. Ideally, a number of event hub partitions that is a multiple of the number of task count.
* Check the balance of each incoming stream partition and, if necessary, force balance upstream.
* Understand the effect of [resetting supervisors](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/api-reference/supervisor-api#reset-a-supervisor).
* [Read about](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/supervisor#tuning-configuration) automatic supervisor resets using `tuningConfig/resetOffsetAutomatically`.
