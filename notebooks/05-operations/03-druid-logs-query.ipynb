    "# Apache Druid and Log4j\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Druid uses Log4J to emit information as it runs. They not only enable you to investigate issues and solve problems, but to understand how each of Druid's processes work in isolation and in collaboration with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this learning module we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the various Druid process log files.\n",
    "* Understand the role of the log files.\n",
    "* Review some task log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in making use of log files is to become aware of what logs are available. We'll see that the Druid processes each generate a couple of different files. In addition to the process log files, we will see that transient Druid worker tasks also generate log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Druid processes run, they write status information into files called log files. We can use these files to understand the Druid processes' behaviors and diagnose problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Druid is a distributed system, we will find log files for each Druid process. In addition, Druid also captures the output written to the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some processes may spin off tasks to perform sub-processing. In Druid, a task is separate process that usually runs in its own JVM. Each of these tasks create their own log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the logs capture behavior during ingestion and other processing, but we can also configure Druid to capture specific query information."
