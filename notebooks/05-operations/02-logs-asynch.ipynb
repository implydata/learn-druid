    "As well as the usual processes in Druid, Druid's highly-parallelised approach to both [streaming](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/#streaming) and [batch](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/#batch) ingestion is carried out by worker tasks. Each of these is a separate process that create their own log files.\n",
