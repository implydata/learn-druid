    "# Apache Druid logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Log configuration and maintenance is an essential task for operators of an Apache Druid cluster. Druid uses the [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) logging framework to emit logs that are useful for day-to-day monitoring and for troubleshooting. They not only enable you to investigate issues and solve problems, but to understand how each of Druid processes work in isolation and in collaboration with one another.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will take a tour of the out-of-the-box Log4J configuration in Apache Druid and use terminal commands to locate and examine its contents."

    "| Any | __NodeRoleWatcher__<br>Across all the processes, watch as they detect changes in the processes that are running in the cluster, and see what they do about it. |\n",
    "| Any | __org.apache.druid.initialization.Initialization__<br>These messages are all about the process starting up. It can be interesting to see what exactly each one does and if it runs into issues. |\n",
    "| Coordinator / Overlord | __org.apache.druid.metadata.SQLMetadataRuleManager__<br>This is the coordinator polling the rules in the metadata database, getting ready to apply them. The log tells you how many rules it picks up and how many data sources they cover. |\n",
    "| Coordinator / Overlord | __org.apache.druid.metadata.SqlSegmentsMetadataManager__<br>Messages show how many segments the cluster thinks are “used” – ready to be used for queries. |\n",
    "| Coordinator / Overlord | __org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.RemoteTaskRunner__<br>GIves interesting information about what’s happening with ingestion resources in the cluster, including when they first advertise themselves. |\n",
    "| Coordinator / Overlord | __org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.rules__<br>Lots of information about how the retention rules are applied. |\n",
    "| Coordinator / Overlord | __org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.BalanceSegments__<br>Here you can see what Druid decides to do when balancing the workload, such as a server is lost or added. |\n",
    "| Historical | __org.apache.druid.server.coordination.BatchDataSegmentAnnouncer__<br>You can see individual segments being announced as available for query by each historical server as it loads them. |\n",
    "| Historical | __org.apache.druid.server.coordination.SegmentLoadDropHandler__<br>As well as seeing how the Historical checks its local segment cache on startup, you can watch as the Historical picks up the instructions from the Coordinator and then does something about them. When there are ERRORs like “Failed to load segment for dataSource”, you get traces about what the process was trying to do – quite often something pointing to an error with its connection to deep storage. |"
