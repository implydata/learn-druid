# Apache Druid Data Modeling

This guide teaches you the fundamentals of ingesting your data into Apache Druid. This course consists of:

- [Designing a good schema](./schema-design.md): expert interviews and Python notebooks that help you create a good table
- Data processing: how to think about when and where to process and query your data
- Optimizing segment layout: understanding partitioning in Druid and how it affects processing
- Summarisation and sketching:  ow to summarize your data at ingestion time and take advantage of approximation

Each module contains an introductory video, links to Python notebooks in the learn-druid environment, and related material such as docs and community videos.

If you'd like to talk to through what you learn in this course, why not say hi to Imply's DevRel team!
