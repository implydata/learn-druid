# Apache Druid Basics

Welcome to the fundamental course on Apache Druid from Imply!

This course brings together critical learning materials that we think are important to your first half an hour with Apache Druid. It's a short course - but one that will get you close to the information you need to experience and understand Druid. Most of the course elements are entirely optional. If you'd like to skip straight to the quiz, go straight ahead!

If you'd like to talk to through what you learn in this course, why not say hi to Imply's DevRel team! Follow this link to find the bookable sessions on offer.
