# Apache Druid Basics

Welcome to the fundamental course on Apache Druid from Imply!

This course brings together critical learning materials that we think are important to your first half an hour with Apache Druid. It's a short course - but one that will get you close to the information you need to experience and understand Druid. Most of the course elements are entirely optional. If you'd like to skip straight to the quiz, go straight ahead!

If you'd like to talk to through what you learn in this course, why not say hi to Imply's DevRel team! Follow this link to find the bookable sessions on offer.

## Druid use cases

The team behind Druid open sourced  the project in 2012.
Druid [graduated to a top-level Apache Project in 2019](https://lists.apache.org/thread/16b4h20gpo2m14mjgb4hz4563glwzs7c).
It's been a massive hit amongst teams who want to reduce latency of event data being delivered to their users, and to support more flexible, ad-hoc querying by their users.

The official Druid website contains an overview of how this real-time analytics database supports multiple [use cases](https://druid.apache.org/use-cases/) including user activity, network flows, digital marketing, and application performance management.
<!-- Feel like we should do a deeper link than imply.io here -->
See the [Imply website](https://imply.io/) for even more uses for Druid.
