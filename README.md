# Learn Druid

The "Learn Druid" repository contains all manner of resources to help you learn and apply [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/)Â®.

It contains:

* Jupyter Notebooks that guide you through query, ingestion, and data management with Apache Druid.
* A Docker Compose file to get you up and running with a learning lab.

Suggestions or comments? Call into the [discussions](https://github.com/implydata/learn-druid/discussions). Found a problem or want to request a notebook? Raise an [issue](https://github.com/implydata/learn-druid/issues). Want to contribute? Raise a [PR](https://github.com/implydata/learn-druid/pulls).
 
Come meet your friendly Apache Druid [community](https://druid.apache.org/community) if you have any questions about the functionality you see here.

## Pre-requisites

To use the "Learn Druid" Docker Compose, you need:

* Git or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Docker Compose
* A machine with at least 6 GiB of RAM.

     > Of course, more power is better.
     > The notebooks have been tested with the following resources available to docker: 6 CPUs, 8GB of RAM, and 1 GB swap.

## Quickstart

To get started quickly:

1. Clone the repository:
    
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/implydata/learn-druid
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
    cd learn-druid
   ```

3. Launch the environment:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile druid-jupyter up -d
   ```

   > The first time you launch the environment, it can take a while to start all the services.

4. Navigate to Jupyter Lab in your browser at `http://localhost:8889/lab`. <br/> From there you can read the introduction or use Jupyter Lab to navigate the notebooks folder.

5. When you're finished, stop all services:

```bash
docker compose --profile druid-jupyter down
```

Once you have cloned the repository, get the latest version as follows:

```bash
git restore .
git pull
```

While using the notebooks, monitor ingestion tasks, compare query results, and more in the [web console](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/web-console) directly at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Profiles

Individual notebooks may state a specific compose profile that you need to use.

Specify the profile after the `--profile` parameter to the `docker compose` command. For example, to start with the `all-services` profile, use this command:

```bash
docker compose --profile all-services up -d
```

To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose --profile all-services down
```

Run the notebooks against an existing Apache Druid database using the `DRUID_HOST` parameter and the `jupyter` profile.

```bash
DRUID_HOST=[host address] docker compose --profile jupyter up -d
```

When you have Druid running on the local machine, use `host.docker.internal` as the _host address_.

```bash
DRUID_HOST=host.docker.internal docker compose --profile jupyter up -d
```

## Components

The Learn Druid environment includes the following services:

[**Jupyter Lab**](https://jupyter.org/): An interactive environment to run Jupyter Notebooks. The image for Jupyter used in the environment contains Python along with all the supporting libraries you need to run the notebooks.

[**Apache Kafka**](https://kafka.apache.org/): Streaming service as a data source for Druid.

[**Imply Data Generator**](https://github.com/implydata/druid-datagenerator): A tool to generate sample data for Druid. It can produce either batch or streaming data.

[**Apache Druid**](https://druid.apache.org/): The currently released version of Apache Druid by default.
